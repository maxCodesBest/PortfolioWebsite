        Hey I'm Max! other than the amazing resume you can find in this website
        (hmm hmm go check it out) I do some cool stuff :)
        <br />
        so first of all I speak spanish fluently and my girlfriend says I love
        dogs way too much. <br />
        also I'm super friendly and love working in team and I'll always have a
        controversial joke to tell.
      </p>
      <h1>The cool stuff</h1>
      <div className="bullets">
        <p>
          • I'm a WSET (Wine and Spirit Education Trust, biggest wine school in
          the world) level 2 and level 3 certified sommelier (it looks cool when
          I taste wines).
          <br />
          • I'm also a cetified bartender and mixologist (technically I make
          really good cocktails).
          <br />
          • I love carpentry and actually did a few courses of that too.
          <br />
          • I also love gardening and (what a shock) did a few courses of that
          too.
          <br />
          • I've been practicing martial arts my entire life doing mainly Judo,
          Jiu jitsu and Muay Thai (thai boxing).
          <br />
          • I can talk about motorcycles for hours even tho I don't ride anymore
          since a terrible accident :(
          <br />
          • I'm wondering if I should learn to speak italian or learn to cook
          professionally as my next challenge so if you have an opinion about
          that add it to your message in the Contact Me page :)
